# 🏠 House Price Prediction (Kaggle - From Scratch with NumPy)

This project implements **Linear Regression from scratch** (without scikit-learn regression models) to predict housing prices on the **Ames Housing Dataset** from Kaggle.  
All parts of the pipeline — data preprocessing, normalization, gradient descent, and cost computation — are manually coded using **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

## 🚀 Overview

- **Goal:** Predict house sale prices using only numerical features.
- **Approach:** Implemented linear regression using gradient descent and vectorized operations.
- **Frameworks Used:** Pure NumPy and Pandas (no sklearn regressors).
- **Evaluation Metric:** Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) — Kaggle metric.
- **Kaggle Score:** 🥈 **0.14875 RMSLE**
